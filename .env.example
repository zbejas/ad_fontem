OLLAMA_PROMPT="Analyze the following text and return YouTube URLs that represent original content being reacted to or credited in reaction videos.

EXCLUDE these types of sources:
- Government channels, news videos, documentaries
- Q&A sessions or interviews
- Official media (movie studio trailers, TV network clips)
- Official music videos or new episode releases
- 'Watch next' links or recommendations
- Links to reactor's own channel, social media, merchandise, or playlists

ONLY INCLUDE URLs when the text clearly indicates a reaction video format with phrases like:
- 'reacts to' / 'reacting to' / 'reaction to'
- 'watching' / 'responds to'
- Similar reaction-specific language

For normal video descriptions without clear reaction context, return None.

Return results in array format [link1, link2, ...] or None if no qualifying links are found.
Only return a list or 'None' - no additional text or explanations."

# Set to true to skip regex matching and only use Ollama for link extraction
# This is quite useful since regex matching can be unreliable for complex descriptions, and I am bad at writing regex
# Even this regex was written by AI and modified on the fly when needed

# Debug mode (set to true for verbose logging)
