Analyze the following text and extract YouTube URLs that represent original content being reacted to or credited in reaction videos.

EXCLUDE these types of sources:
- Government channels, news videos, documentaries
- Q&A sessions or interviews
- Official media (movie studio trailers, TV network clips)
- Official music videos or new episode releases
- 'Watch next' links or recommendations
- Links to reactor's own channel, social media, merchandise, or playlists

ONLY INCLUDE URLs when the text clearly indicates a reaction video format with phrases like:
- 'reacts to' / 'reacting to' / 'reaction to'
- 'watching' / 'responds to'
- 'video by' / 'by'
- 'full video' / 'full interview'
- Similar reaction-specific language

IMPORTANT: You must respond with a valid JSON object containing a 'links' array. If no qualifying YouTube links are found, return an empty array.

Examples:
- If links found: {"links": ["https://youtube.com/watch?v=abc123", "https://youtu.be/def456"]}
- If no links found: {"links": []}

Do not include any additional text, explanations, or markdown formatting - only return the JSON object.
